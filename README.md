# Custom MVC

The project **Custom MVC** is PHP open-source web application MVC framework.  

## Installation and requirements

Clone the repository from GitHub or download it as a ZIP file:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/ManoelViktorovManev/Custom_MVC.git
     ```
   - If you downloaded the ZIP file, extract it to your desired directory.


This project requires **PHP 8** or above to run. Ensure that PHP is installed and accessible from the command line.

Make sure you are having database management system (DBMS) like  **MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL** or others.

### Configuration and Setup

1. **Edit the Configuration File**: Open the `.env` file in the project’s root directory and configure the following values:
   - **`DATABASE_URL`**: Defines the database connection string.
   - **`LOCAL_TIMEZONE`**: Sets the timezone for log entries.

2. **Start the Database**: Ensure your database application is running and accessible based on the DATABASE_URL configuration.

3. **Run the Server**: In the terminal, navigate to your project directory and start the PHP server:
```
php -S localhost:8080
```
Your application should now be accessible at http://localhost:8080.


## Routes
**Routes** in this project are defined using attributes within each method of the Controller classes. Each route attribute specifies the path and parameters for accessing that method, allowing the framework to map URLs to specific controller actions.

There are four main types of routes you can define:
```
#[Route('/path')]                         // Basic route with a fixed path.
#[Route('/user/{id}')]                    // Route with a dynamic parameter, e.g., /user/123.
#[Route('/normal/test', name: 'param')]   // Named route, useful for generating URLs programmatically.
#[Route('/optional/{id?}')]               // Optional parameter, e.g., /optional/ or /optional/123.
```





## Controllers
All controllers should be placed in the **/controller** directory. Each controller class should extend the **BaseController** class to gain access to the framework’s core functionality. Each controller method should return **Response** object.

### Defining a Controller Method
To create a route in a controller, annotate the method with a **#[Route(...)]** attribute. The framework will use this route to call the corresponding method when the URL matches.

Example Controller Method:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Controller;

use App\Core\BaseController;
use App\Core\Route;
use App\Core\Response;

class TestController extends BaseController
{
    #[Route('/normal/test')]
    public function testingNormalResponse()
    {
        // Example response
        return new Response('Test text');
    }
}
```
### Available Controller Methods
The **BaseController** provides several helper methods that make it easier to handle common tasks, such as returning JSON responses, rendering templates, and generating URLs.

### json(data)
Returns a JSON response. Use this to send structured data in JSON format. Returns **Response** object.
```
return $this->json(['status' => 'success', 'data' => $data]);
```

### render(view,params)
Renders a view template. This method takes the path to an HTML template and an optional array of variables to pass to the view. Returns **Response** object.

```
return $this->render('home.html');
return $this->render('home.html', ['title' => 'Home Page']);

```

### redirectToRoute(routeName,param)
Redirects to a specified route by name. Useful for navigation within the application without hardcoding URLs. Returns **Response** object.
```
return $this->redirectToRoute('param'); // it will redirect to 'param' name route which is '/normal/test' path
```

### redirect(url)
Redirects the user to a specified URL. This method is useful for external redirects or when you want full control over the URL. Returns **Response** object.
```
return $this->redirect('https://example.com');
return $this->redirect('/path');
```

### generateUrl(routeName,param)
Generates a URL for a named route. This method is particularly useful when you need to create a link to another route within the application, as it allows you to build URLs dynamically based on route names. Returns **String**.
```
$url = $this->generateUrl('user_profile', ['id' => 42]);
```


## Models
**Models (or Entities)** in this project are responsible for interacting with the database. They should be placed in the **/model** directory and must extend the **BaseModel** class to inherit the necessary database functionality.

Each model should include an **id** parameter, which serves as the primary identifier for each record.

Example Model:
```
class User extends BaseModel
{
    private $id;
    private $name;
    private $email;

    // Getters and setters for properties...

    public function __construct($id = null, $name = '', $email = '')
    {
        $this->id = $id;
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->email = $email;
    }
}
```
In controller you can access it by this:
```
#[Route('/normal/test')]
    public function testingNormalResponse()
    {
        // Example response
        $user = new User();
        $user->setName('test'); // setter
        $user->setEmail('test@gmail.com'); //setter
        
        return new Response('Test text');
    }
```



### Available Model Methods
The BaseModel provides several helper methods for interacting with the database. These methods simplify common database operations.
### findAll()
Retrieves all records from the associated table.
```
$users = $user->findAll();
```
### findById(id)
Finds a record by its unique identifier (id).
```
$user = $this->findById(1);
```
### insert()
Inserts a new record into the database.
```
$user = new User();
$user->setName('test'); 
$user->setEmail('test@gmail.com'); 
$user->insert();
```
### update(id)
Updates an existing record in the database using the given id.
```
$user = $this->findById(1);
$user->setName('John Smith');
$user->update($user->getId()); // same as $user->update(1);
```
### delete(id)
Deletes a record from the database based on its unique id.
```
$user->delete(1);
```
### customSQL(sql_query)
Allows you to execute custom SQL queries. This is useful for complex queries or operations that don't fit the standard CRUD methods.
```
$sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'john@example.com'";
$result = $this->customSQL($sql);
```

## Views

Views are responsible for the **HTML** structure and presentation of your application. All view files should be placed in the **/view** directory, and each view should be an **.html** file containing standard HTML markup.
```
<!-- /view/example.html -->
<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>This is a sample HTML page.</p>

```

### Passing Data to Views
You can pass data from the controller to the view using the **render()** method. Within the HTML, use **{{ parameter }}** syntax to display dynamic data provided by the controller.

Example:

Controller Method:
```
#[Route('/greeting')]
public function showGreeting()
{
    $name = "John";
    $content = "Welcome to our website!";
    return $this->render('greeting.html', ['name' => $name, 'content' => $content]);
}
```
View File (/view/greeting.html):
```
<h1>Hello, {{ name }}!</h1>
<p>{{ content }}</p>
```
In this example, **{{ name }}** and **{{ content }}** in the view file are placeholders that will be replaced by the values passed in the **render()** method **('name' => $name and 'content' => $content)**.

### Passing an Array to a View
Suppose you have a controller method where you want to pass an associative array to a view:
```
#[Route('/user/profile')]
public function showUserProfile()
{
    // Define an associative array with user data
    $user = [
        'id' => 1,
        'name' => 'John Doe',
        'email' => 'john@example.com'
    ];

    // Render the view and pass the array as a parameter
    return $this->render('profile.html', ['user' => $user]);
}
```
Now, in the view, you can access the properties of the user array by referencing **{{ user.key }}** for each key in the array:
```
<h1>User Profile</h1>
<p>User ID: {{ user.id }}</p>
<p>Name: {{ user.name }}</p>
<p>Email: {{ user.email }}</p>
```
